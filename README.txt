# Adaptive-Dynamics
Numerical Resolution of the Canonical Equation of Adaptive Dynamics for a Lotka-Volterra system. 

The equations solved here are the ones presented in the paper:
The dynamical theory of coevolution: a derivation from stochastic ecological processes, Ulf Dieckmann & Richard Law
The images presented in Github have been ploted with gnuplot the parameter set of each case is provided in the paper.
EXTERNAL FUNCTIONS ARE DEFFINED ACCORDING THE WITH THE PAPER

In folder "saddle" you can find the data for the plots. The image have been done with gnuplot, the gnuplot code is in 
"dibujo.txt", just write: " load 'dibujo.txt' " in the gnuplot terminal.
